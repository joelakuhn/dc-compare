# D&C Compare

This is a tool for comparing different versions of the Doctrines and Covenants.

## Building

There is no additional setup or build required to use the app. If you clone the repo, you can simply open index.html and it will work. If you want to build a combined version with all the files in one stand alone file for offline use, you can run build-combined.rb
