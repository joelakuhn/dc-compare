1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, unto you my servant Stephen Burnett, go ye, go ye into the world, and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under the sound of your voice, and inasmuch as you desire a companion I will give unto you my servant Eden Smith: wherefore go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north, or to the south; to the east, or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss: therefore declare the things which ye have heard and verily believe, and know to be true. Behold this is the will of him who hath called you, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ: Amen.
