1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, I give unto the united order, organized agreeable to the commandment previously given, a revelation and commandment concerning my servant Shederlaomach Frederick G. Williams, that ye shall receive him into the order. What I say unto one I say unto all.

2 And again, I say unto you, my servant Shederlaomach, you shall be a lively member in this order; and inasmuch as you are faithful in keeping all former commandments, you shall be blessed forever: Amen.
