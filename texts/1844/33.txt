[verses]
1 Behold I say unto you, my servants Ezra and Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, whose word is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow, soul and spirit: and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. For verily, verily I say unto you, that ye are called to lift up your voices as with the sound of a trump, to declare my gospel unto a crooked and a perverse generation: for behold the field is white already to harvest; and it is the eleventh hour, and for the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard. And my vineyard has become corrupted every whit: and there is none which doeth good save it be a few; and they err in many instances, because of priestcrafts, all having corrupt minds.

2 And verily, verily I say unto you, that this church have I established and called forth out of the wilderness: and even so will I gather mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, even as many as will believe in me, and hearken unto my voice: yea, verily, verily I say unto you, that the field is white already to harvest; wherefore thrust in your sickles, and reap with all your might, mind and strength. Open your mouths and they shall be filled; and you shall become even as Nephi of old, who journeyed from Jerusalem in the wilderness: yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo I am with you: yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled, saying, Repent, repent and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand: yea, repent and be baptized every one of you; for the remission of your sins; yea, be baptized even by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost.

3 Behold, verily, verily I say unto you, this is my gospel, and remember that they shall have faith in me, or they can in no wise be saved: and upon this Rock I will build my church; yea, upon this rock ye are built, and if ye continue, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; and ye shall remember the church articles and covenants to keep them: and whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the hands, and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them. And the book of Mormon, and the holy scriptures, are given of me for your instruction; and the power of my Spirit quickeneth all things: wherefore be faithful, praying always, having your lamps trimmed and burning, and oil with you, that you may be ready at the coming of the Bridegroom: for behold, verily, verily I say unto you, that I come quickly; even so: Amen.
