Section 69

[verses]
1 Behold thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant William; yea, even the Lord of the whole earth, thou art called and chosen and after thou hast been baptized by water, which if you do with an eye single to my glory, you shall have a remission of your sins, and a reception of the Holy Spirit, by the laying on of hands. And then thou shalt be ordained by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, jr. to be an elder unto this church, to preach repentance and remission of sins by way of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and on whomsoever you shall lay your hands, if they are contrite before me, you shall have power to give the Holy Spirit.

2 And again, you shall be ordained to assist my servant Oliver Cowdery to do the work of printing, and of selecting, and writing books for schools, in this church, that little children also may receive instruction before me as is pleasing unto me. And again, verily I say unto you, for this cause you shall take your journey with my servants Joseph Smith, jr. and Sidney Rigdon, that you may be planted in the land of your inheritance, to do this work.

3 And again let my servant Joseph Coe also take his journey with them. The residue shall be made known hereafter; even as I will: Amen.
