[original chapter]
Section 88

[verses]
1 Verily thus saith the Lord, in addition to the laws of the church concerning women and children, those who belong to the church, who have lost their husbands or fathers: women have claim on their husbands for their maintainance until their husbands are taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have fellowship in the church, and if they are not faithful, they shall not have fellowship in the church; yet they may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land.

2 All children have claim upon their parents for their maintainance until they are of age; and after that, they have claim upon the church; or, in other words upon the Lord's storehouse, if their parents have not wherewith to give them inheritances. And the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church, that widows and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor. Amen.
