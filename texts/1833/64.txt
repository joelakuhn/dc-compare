[verses]
BEHOLD, thus saith the Lord your God unto you, O ye elders of my church, hearken ye, and hear, and receive my will concerning you:

2 For verily I say unto you, I will that ye should overcome the world:

3 Wherefore I will have compassion upon you.

4 There are those among you who have sinned;

5 But verily I say, for this once, for mine own glory, and for the salvation of souls, I have forgiven you your sins.

6 I will be merciful unto you, for I have given unto you the kingdom:

7 And the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom, shall not be taken from my servant Joseph, while he liveth, inasmuch as he obeyeth mine ordinances.

8 There are those who have sought occasion against him without cause;

9 Nevertheless he has sinned, but verily I say unto you, I the Lord forgiveth sins unto those who confess their sins before me, and ask forgiveness, who have not sinned unto death.

10 My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another, and forgave not one another in their hearts, and for this evil they were afflicted, and sorely chastened:

11 Wherefore I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another, for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses, standeth condemned before the Lord, for there remaineth in him the greater sin.

12 I the Lord will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men;

13 And ye ought to say in your hearts, Let God judge between me and thee, and reward thee according to thy deeds.

14 And he that repenteth not of his sins, and confesseth them not, then ye shall bring him before the church, and do with him as the Scriptures saith unto you, either by commandment, or by revelation.

15 And this ye shall do that God might be glorified, not because ye forgive not, having not compassion, but that ye may be justified in the eyes of the law, that ye may not offend him who is your Lawgiver.

16 Verily I say, for this cause ye shall do these things.

17 Behold I the Lord was angry with him who was my servant Ezra (Booth);

18 And also, my servant Isaac Morley; for they kept not the law, neither the commandment: they sought evil in their hearts, and I the Lord withheld my Spirit.

19 They condemned for evil, that thing in which there was no evil:

20 Nevertheless I have forgiven my servant Isaac.

21 And also my servant Edward Partridge, behold he hath sinned, and satan seeketh to destroy his soul;

22 But when these things are made known unto them, they repent of the evil, and they shall be forgiven.

23 And now verily I say, that it is expedient in me that my servant Sidney (Gilbert) after a few weeks, should return upon his business, and to his agency in the land of Zion;

24 And that which he hath seen and heard may be made known unto my disciples, that they perish not.

25 And for this cause have I spoken these things.

26 And again, I say unto you, that my servant Isaac may not be tempted above that which he is able to bear, and counsel wrongfully to your hurt, I gave commandment that this farm should be sold.

27 I willeth not that my servant Frederick G. Williams, should sell his farm, for I the Lord willeth to retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years, in the which I will not overthrow the wicked, that thereby I may save some;

28 And after that day, I the Lord will not hold any guilty, that shall go, with an open heart, up to the land of Zion:

29 For I the Lord requireth the hearts of the children of men.

30 Behold now it is called today, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people;

31 For he that is tithed shall not be burned; for after today cometh the burning:

32 This is speaking after the manner of the Lord;

33 For verily I say, tomorrow all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble: and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of hosts;

34 And I will not spare any that remaineth in Babylon.

35 Wherefore, if ye believe me, ye will labor while it is called today.

36 And it is not meet that my servants, Newel K. Whitney and Sidney (G.) should sell their store, and their possessions here, for this is not wisdom until the residue of the church, which remaineth in this place, shall go up unto the land of Zion.

37 Behold it is said in my laws, or forbidden to get in debt to thine enemies;

38 But behold it is not said at any time, that the Lord should not take when he please, and pay as seemeth him good:

39 Wherefore as ye are agents, and ye are on the Lord's errand; and whatever ye do according to the will of the Lord, is the Lord's business, and it is the Lord's business to provide for his saints in these last days, that they may obtain an inheritance in the land of Zion:

40 And behold I the Lord declare unto you, and my words are sure and shall not fail, that they shall obtain it;

41 But all things must come to pass in its time;

42 Wherefore be not weary in well doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.

43 And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.

44 Behold the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind;

45 And the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days;

46 And the rebellious shall be cut off out of the land of Zion, and shall be sent away and shall not inherit the land:

47 For verily I say that the rebellious are not of the blood of Ephraim.

Wherefore they shall be plucked out Behold I the Lord have made my Church in these last days like unto a judge sitting on a hill or in an high place to judge the nations for it shall come to pass that the inhabitants of Zion shall judge all things and all liars and hypocrites shall be proved by them and they which are not Apostles and prophets shall be known and the judge and his Counselors if they are not faithful in there Stewardship shall be Condemned and others shall be planted in there stead for behold I say unto you that Zion shall flourish and the glory of the Lord shall be upon her and she shall be an ensign unto the people And there shall come unto her out of evry Nation under heaven and the days shall come when the Nations of the earth shall tremble because of her and shall fear becaus of her terrible ones the Lord hath spoken it Amen.
