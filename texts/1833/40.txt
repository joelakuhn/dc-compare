[verses]
BEHOLD, verily I say unto you, that his heart was right before me, for he covenanted with me, that he would obey my word.

2 And he received the word with gladness, but straitway satan tempted him; and the fear of persecution, and the cares of the world, caused him to reject the word:

3 Wherefore he broke my covenant, and it remaineth in me to do with him as seemeth me good. Amen.
