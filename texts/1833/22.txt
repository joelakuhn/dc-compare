Chapter 23

[verses]
BEHOLD I say unto you, that all old covenants have I caused to be done away in this thing, and this is a new and everlasting covenant; even that which was from the beginning.

2 Wherefore although a man should be baptized an hundred times, it availeth him nothing;

3 For you cannot enter in at the straight gate by the law of Moses, neither by your dead works;

4 For it is because of your dead works, that I have caused this last covenant, and this church to be built up unto me; even as in days of old.

5 Wherefore enter ye in at the gate, as I have commanded, and seek not to counsel your God.- Amen.
