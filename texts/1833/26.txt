[verses]
BEHOLD, I say unto you, that you shall let your time be devoted to the studying of the scriptures, and to preaching, and to confirming the church at Colesville;

2 And to performing your labors on the land, such as is required, until after you shall go to the west, to hold the next conference; and then it shall be made known what you shall do.

3 And all things shall be done by common consent in the church, by much prayer and faith;

4 For all things you shall receive by faith. Amen.
