[verses]
BEHOLD, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he who was crucified for the sins of the world.

2 Behold, verily, verily I say unto you, my servant Newel, you shall stand fast in the office wherewith I have appointed you:

3 And if your brethren desire to escape their enemies let them repent of all their sins, and become truly humble before me and contrite:

4 And as the covenant which they made unto me, has been broken, even so it has become void and of none effect;

5 And wo to him by whom this offence cometh, for it had been better for him that he had been drowned in the depth of the sea;

6 But blessed are they who have kept the covenant, and observed the commandment, for they shall obtain mercy:

7 Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you:

8 And take your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay moneys for you.

9 And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites.

10 And after you have done journeying, behold I say unto you, seek ye a living like unto men, until I prepare a place for you.

11 And again, be patient in tribulation until I come:

12 And behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, and they who have sought me early, shall find rest to their souls; even so: Amen.
