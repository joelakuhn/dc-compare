[verses]
BEHOLD it is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a regular history, and assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all things which shall be given you.

2 Again, verily I say unto you, that he can also lift up his voice in meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.

3 And again, I say unto you, that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church record and history continually, for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office:

4 Wherefore it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the Comforter, to write these things; even so: Amen.
