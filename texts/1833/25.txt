[verses]
EMMA, my daughter in Zion, a revelation I give unto you, concerning my will:

2 Behold thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou art an elect lady, whom I have called.

3 Murmur not because of the things which thou hast not seen, for they are withheld from thee, and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to come.

4 And the office of thy calling shall be for a comfort unto my servant Joseph, thy husband, in his afflictions with consoling words, in the spirit of meekness.

5 And thou shalt go with him at the time of his going, and be unto him for a scribe, that I may send Oliver Cowdery whithersoever I will.

6 And thou shalt be ordained under his hand to expound scriptures, and to exhort the church, according as it shall be given thee by my Spirit:

7 For he shall lay his hands upon thee, and thou shalt receive the Holy Ghost, and thy time shall be given to writing, and to learning much.

8 And thou needest not fear, for thy husband shall support thee from the church:

9 For unto them is his calling, that all things might be revealed unto them, whatsoever I will according to their faith.

10 And verily I say unto thee, that thou shalt lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better.

11 And it shall be given thee, also, to make a selection of sacred Hymns, as it shall be given thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church:

12 For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart: Yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me.

13 And it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.

14 Wherefore lift up thy heart and rejoice, and cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made.

15 Continue in the spirit of meekness, and beware of pride.

16 Let thy soul delight in thy husband, and the glory which shall come unto him.

17 Keep my commandments continually, and a crown of righteousness thou shalt receive.

18 And except thou do this, where I am you cannot come.

19 And verily, verily I say unto you, that this is my voice unto all. Amen.
