[verses]
BEHOLD thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, it is expedient in me that the elders of my church should be called together, from the east and from the west, and from the north and from the south, by letter or some other way.

2 And it shall come to pass, that, inasmuch as they are faithful, and exercise faith in me, I will pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together.

3 And it shall come to pass that they shall go forth into the regions round about, and preach repentance unto the people;

4 And many shall be converted, insomuch that ye shall obtain power to organize yourselves, according to the laws of man;

5 That your enemies may not have power over you, that you may be preserved in all things;

6 That you may be enabled to keep my laws, that every band may be broken wherewith the enemy seeketh to destroy my people.

7 Behold I say unto you, that ye must visit the poor and the needy and administer to their relief, that they may be kept until all things may be done according to my law which ye have received: Amen.
